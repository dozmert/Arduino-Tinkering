# Arduino-tinkering

### Synopsis
A collection of small projects I'm working on using Arduino and various modules. This is a derivative off my [Arduino-rubberducky](https://github.com/dozmert/Arduino-rubberducky) project that I've worked on in the past.

Please note that I have approached the documentation for these projects in different ways and their presentation may vary. Over time I aim to align them all to a uniform template but this is not always possible when I write as I progress through trial & error.
